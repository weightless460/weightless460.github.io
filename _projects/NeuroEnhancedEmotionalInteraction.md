Here’s the project paper: 
- **Xiang, Y.** A System Design for Multi-Modal Emotion Regulation and Management in Human-Robot and Human-Computer Interactions.'' In *2024 19th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)*. (Submitted). 

**Research on Emotion Recognition and Regulation:**

Analysis of the core literature in the Web of Science indicates a quantifiable growth in the research on emotion recognition and regulation in recent years. Keywords analysis revealed a close relationship between emotion recognition and regulation and electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. A knowledge graph analysis was conducted on the connectivity between emotions and brain-machine-related factors.

**Expert Interview Coding:**

In-depth interviews were conducted with doctors from the **Shanghai Mental Health Center**. The interviews covered five main sections, including professional experience, emotional triggers, emotion regulation strategies, and specific implementation methods.

**User Study:**

**Survey:**

The survey included sections on personal information, self-assessment of daily emotional states, three scales (**PSS** for stress, **SAS** for anxiety, **SDS** for depression), and crowd demands for stress relief and healing elements and methods.

**Target User Identification and Coding:**

Based on self-assessment and scale results, 24 users with high stress and anxiety values were selected for interviews and coding. The study identified user personas and preferences for relaxing scenes.

**User Needs:**

Real-time perception of emotional states, emotional system management, positive guidance, and regulation for stress and emotional issues. Users require visual and quantifiable indicators to perceive their current emotional states.

**System Design and Development:**

*Software Development:*
Rhino was used for scene prototyping, Touch Designer and Unity for rendering, and Launch Virtual Serial Port Driver for serial communication and brain-machine interaction. The platform was developed for emotional recognition and visualization by exploring EEG data.

*Hardware:*
EEG caps (eego mylab), Emotiv BCI Epoc, and related brain-machine interface devices were used for signal capture and real-time interaction.

**I. Monitoring and Identification System:**

Utilizing different frequency data, brain-machine interface signals were processed for serial communication and then visualized using Touch Designer. The system included emotional decoding algorithm development.

**II. Emotion Regulation System:**

Six categories of video stimuli were selected to validate their impact on user emotional stress (plants, fire, stream, rainy weather, sunlight, seaside).

**III. Management and Service System:**

Customized emotion management includes monitoring and regulation. The monitoring system visualizes EEG waves for user perception, while the regulation system offers various modules and real-time monitoring, allowing users to select emotion management health reports.
