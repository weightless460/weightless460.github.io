This is a project I led when I was being a research assistant in the MIT Media Lab-City Science Lab @ Shanghai for one year. And published as the first author in DIS ‘23 WiP.

    Human-plant Symbiosis Scenario Using the DeGov4VC Platform Interface.
</div>


Does the decentralized nature of user behavior in interactive virtual communities help create rules promoting user engagement? Through scenarios like planting, this framework suggests a new paradigm for mutual influence that allows users to impact communities’ political decisions. Sixteen participants in the first round of interviews were involved in the framework’s creation. Then we developed and implemented our framework in the community with the help of other stakeholders. This proof-of-concept creates user groups using information from users’ daily activities as input and grows the green plants in a virtual environment. Finally, we involved AI agents and stakeholders in the framework test and iterations. Our study’s user evaluation of a few key stakeholders demonstrates how our strategy enhances user viscosity and experience. Via human-planting ecosystems in a virtual community, this research gives a fresh viewpoint on decentralized governance and an engaging method for co-creating interactive ecological communities.

# Research Quesitons
- How can users be encouraged to engage in green activities and participate in the decision-making process in the virtual community?  
- Specifically, what gathering forms of decentralized governance in virtual communities can better promote the interactive co-creation of human-plant symbiosis have been significant research problems?

# Concept & Design Principles
## Concept

This study focuses on two main aspects: 
- Human-machine Collaboration through Virtual Community
- Decentralized Governance

## Design Principles
- **Decentralization**: Introduce the design philosophy with decen-tralization in our framework, and start from a bottom-up perspective, turning the decision-making process into a collective behavior.
- **Co-creation approach**: Encourage the co-creation of virtual communities by users and AI agents, where users can construct within the virtual community that they can co-create in many processes. 
- **Scenarios**: Take the symbiotic scenario of humans and plants as a design case to elicit how to make decisions among the expected behavior between the community and users.
- **User's experience**: Emphasize better human-centered experience of users, through which users' feedback in the decision-making and co-creation process becomes more visible and feasible.

# Co-Design System
We adopted an interactive co-design approach [5] to learn from policy decisions, decentralization, and community residents and their desired experience of human-plant symbiosis. The co-design process focused on two main issues:
- Identify the shared expectations of multiple stakeholders for a human-plant symbiotic virtual community.
- Make an interactive decision-making process from multiple opinions and get optimal design results.

# Methodology
The DeGov4VC implemented a virtual community with AI agents and provided a client as a user interface.

In the human-machine co-creation process, we use a parameterized decentralized governance policy to regulate the community co-creation process, which determines the community structure and the collective decision-making process.

We propose a creative and interactive design framework to improve decentralized governance for virtual community by combining the collaborative creation and policy decisions of real users and AI agents, which shows the workflow of how different stakeholders will collaborate and interact in our system.


# Contribution Highlights
- Promote a decentralized approach to governance, helping people gain a new concept of decentralized decision-making and a more desirable interactive co-creation community.
- Create an interactive VR co-creation platform, allowing users to perceive community change through voting. Taking human-plant symbiosis as one of the various scenarios, we emphasize creativity in the design process.
- Design a framework in the interactive decision-making process through simulation to assist stakeholders with co-design in the virtual community and evaluate co-design impact through agent-based simulation.
- Propose a CO-DESIGN SYSTEM, identifying the shared expectations of multiple stakeholders for a human-plant symbiotic virtual community & Make an interactive decision-making process from multiple opinions and get optimal design results.
