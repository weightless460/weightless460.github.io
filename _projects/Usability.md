This is a project I led when I was Information and Interaction Lab @ School of Design for over 2 year. And published as the first author in ISTE ‘22 conference.    

Here’s the project paper link:
- **Xiang, Y.**, Chang, D., Yao, Y., Wang, L., Chen, A., & Li, J. (2022). Usability Evaluation of Elder-Friendly Design: Application to Take Alipay App. _In Transdisciplinarity and the Future of Engineering (pp. 154-163), IOS Press, https://doi.org/10.3233/ATDE220642._


With the permeation of mobile intelligent devices, various applications have become necessary for people to obtain essential services. Although many apps claim that they have considered the use of seniors and developed elder-friendly modes, research has shown that there are still significant problems for senior people in actually using these apps.

Previous studies have shown that when designing for middle-aged and elderly people, their physical characteristics and cognitive abilities need to be especially considered. 

# Research Problem
Explore the **usability** and **learnability** problem of the elder-friendly design for the real elder people in mobile apps.

As the most popular App in China (like PayPal), Alipay's normal mode and elder-friendly mode will be compared in this research, and their usability and learnability will be emphatically analyzed.

# Methodology and Experiment Design
The purpose of our experiment is to verify whether the **elder-friendly mode** significantly improves the **usability** of middle-aged and elderly people compared with the **normal mode**. 

We take Alipay App as an example in this experiment to conduct research from the aspects of **information architecture**, **interface design**, and **task flow**.

Based on the evaluation results, design improvement strategies suitable for senior users will be proposed.

## Experiment subjects 
16 participants between the ages of 45 and 59 were recruited for the experiment were randomly divided into 2 groups, of which group A (GA) used Alipay's normal mode to complete the tasks, and group B (GB) used Alipay's elder-friendly mode as shown in table 1.

    </div>
</div>


All participants are in good physical condition, without severe visual impairment, and meet the basic conditions to perform our tasks. 



## Experiment tools
- Tobii Pro Glasses2 eye tracker
- Printed System Usability Scale (SUS)
- Several task instruction cards
- A mobile phone with Alipay installed 
- A video recording appliance


## Evaluation metrics
Two categories of measurement indicators were formulated: **objective and subjective metrics**

**Objective measurement indicators**:
- Completion time of each task
- Completion rates
- Number of mistakes
- Times of requests for operation clue
- Home page 30s static observation heat map
- Heat map of each task page before jumping
- Area of interest (AOI) Total Fixation Duration  


## Subjective measurement indicators
- Modified System Usability Scale (SUS) 
- Interview results after the experiment

# Discussion
## Design Improvement Suggestions
- Information Architecture and Relevance:
   - Embody consistency in function portal design for easy recognition across interfaces.
   - Ensure content above and below the hierarchy is relevant to enhance usability for the elderly.

- Task Organization and Perceivability:
   - Avoid multi-level tasks on the same page to maintain a clear order of operations.
   - Ensure the order of operations within the same page is easily perceivable.

- Choice Simplification:
   - Streamline multiple choices with the same function to reduce screening time and alleviate the selection burden.
   - Ensure a straightforward and visually intuitive task flow on the interface, prioritizing usability for the elderly.
  
- Visual and Symbolic Elements:
   - Evaluate the systematic effects of color and physical size on the visual focus of the elderly.
   - Design icons with symbols and imagery metaphors familiar to the elderly.

## Further development
This study aims to investigate and assess the usability of elder-friendly design, providing valuable design improvement suggestions. Additionally, exploring innovative interactive methods, including voice, vision, gestures, etc., can enhance elder-friendly design further. The interdisciplinary design recommendations aim to address current usability challenges in elder-friendly design, offering crucial insights for future research.
