# Abstract

Auditory-verbal training is essential for children with hearing challenges, and the gamification approach has become a promising direction for improving the rehabilitation experience and effect. However, the specific influence of the gamified training approach on participants at different rehabilitation stages has not been empirically studied. 
This paper is thusly intended to investigate the Research Questions:

1. Do the training performances of children at advanced rehabilitation stage differ before and after using the gamified training system? 
2. Do the training performances of children at intermediate rehabilitation stage differ before and after using the gamified training system? 
3. Do children enjoy the gamified training approach? 

For the purpose, a digital gamified auditory-verbal training system was originally developed, and a series of user experiments were organized. Particularly, 31 hearing-challenged children aging between 3-6 years old at an auditory-verbal rehabilitation center were recruited to take the training, and 6 professional therapists were also invited to assist with the experiments and attend the interviews. Based on the training performance observation and interviews with participants, their parents and the therapists, it can be found that generally the gamified training approach can effectively facilitate the training experience, and help with the basic auditory memory and expression capabilities. Moreover, it is feasible to be applied in practical training due to the high customization of digital training contents, multi-modal interactive training means, and highly enjoyable training experience. Regarding the specific influence, the gamified way can better improve the basic auditory-verbal performance of children at the intermediate stage, since they focus more on the ease of learning and adaption to the training system. While, for children at the advanced rehabilitation stage, the precise training and professional training content are more demanded, and thusly, it is not easy to achieve quick improvements. These findings and conclusions can provide insights for the further exploration and application of the gamification approach in children’s auditory-verbal rehabilitation. 


# Game Design and Development  
A digital auditory-verbal training game was originally developed. Particularly, different training tasks were designed based on children’s hearing capabilities and development states at intermediate and advanced rehabilitation stages. With the training game prototype, participants were recruited to use the training game. Their training performance will be recorded and analyzed to verify if the gamified training approach has any influence on the training effect.

The auditory-verbal training game named "Hear to See" was developed to assist hearing-challenged children between three to six years old. Especially, their skills in sound volume perception, auditory memory, auditory description, articulation abilities, sentence expression, and cognitive abilities will be focused and trained. Figure 1 shows the whole game structure.

# Experiment design and Process
Regarding the experiment process, it covers three main stages (as shown in Figure 6). The first stage is the preparation. The experiment purpose, procedures, and guidelines were explained to the participants and their parents. With the assistance of the therapist in the rehabilitation center, basic information of the participants was recorded, and their hearing ability will be assessed.

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    Experiment environment 
</div>


During the experiment, participants were assigned with training games matching with their rehabilitation stage. For example, the children at intermediate rehabilitation stage need to try the Warming up, Auditory memory, and Articulation and expression games. Correspondingly, the children at advanced rehabilitation stage need to try all the games from Warming up to Direction recognition. For each game, 5 minutes were assigned for participants to practice, so that 20-25 minutes in total was spent for each round of training.

The whole game process of all participants was recorded. Considering that the Sound Leaping game is a warm-up game, no data analysis will be performed. The specific data recorded are summarized as below.
- **Scenario Matching**: Participants’ completion time, and the number of times the scenario description has been played until the participants can correctly complete the training task.
- **Scenario Understanding Test**: Participants’ completion time, scores, the number of times the scenario description has been played, and the incorrect answers from participants.
- **Lip-syncing**: Participants’ facial expressions (especially the mouth position), the number of times the audio description has been played, the completion time, the number of pronunciation errors, and specific errors in sound and mouth positions.
- **Dubbing Game**: Participants’ completion time, the number of times the audio description has been played, the number of pronunciation errors, and specific errors in sound and intonation.
- **Direction Game**: Participants’ completion time and pronunciation errors.

The third stage is the post-experiment assessment. After the training of two weeks, participants’ hearing abilities will be re-assessed with the assistance from the therapists using the assessment tools abovementioned. Besides, User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) is employed to evaluate the training experience with this gamified rehabilitation system. Moreover, in-depth interviews are arranged to collect the comments and suggestions from the participants (their guardians) and the therapists in the rehabilitation center. 

With the experiment data recorded, participants’ training performance will be compared before and after experiment, in order to evaluate whether the gamified training approach can effectively improve their auditory-verbal performance and the training performance. The experience rating scales and interview feedbacks will be analyzed to investigate if the gamified training approach is emotionally satisfying and enjoyable.



# Results Analysis
Particularly, an analysis strategy consisting of auditory memory evaluation, articulation and expression evaluation, direction cognition evaluation, training engagement evaluation, and training experience evaluation was proposed.

Based on the results analysis, the gamified system can generally achieve positive influence on participants’ auditory memory, articulation and expression, training engagement and training experience. 


# Discussion

**The varying impact of gamified training on children’s auditory-verbal abilities at different rehabilitation stages**

Through comparing children’s training performance between advanced and intermediate rehabilitation stages, it can be found that the gamified approach generally shows more effective influence on children at intermediate rehabilitation stage, especially in the basic auditory (i.e., auditory memory) and verbal (i.e., articulation, auditory description with hints, language for expression) capabilities. It can be understood that for children at the preliminary rehabilitation stage, the training measure which can attract them to practice more may lead to obvious improvements. However, for the children at advanced rehabilitation stage, it is not easy to achieve quick improvement just through the gamification of the training content. 

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/project_imgs/gavt/gavt/18.jpg" title="DUIIT image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    
</div>

Through a comparison, it is extremely clear that children with intermediate auditory-verbal capabilities can achieve better improvements. The Scenario understanding test is helpful to change the training performance of children at intermediate rehabilitation stage, but appears not effective enough to influence children at the advanced stage. The finding is consistent with above that the more complex and professional training content may better fit the children at advanced stage, and the specific gamification methods and elements should match with participants’ skill levels well.

For scenario-matching test, because advanced-stage children already possess most of the auditory memory and auditory description skills, achieving a higher level of improvement in auditory memory would require extended training and consolidation. Consequently, their abilities did not show significant enhancements after short-term training. 

The performance of children in the intermediate stage of rehabilitation in the situational game reveals notable improvements. Therefore, after training with the system, most aspects of their performance displayed significant enhancements, indicating the effectiveness of this system as a training tool.

# Feasibility of the gamified auditory-verbal training approach
Based on the joint analysis of participants’ and therapists’ interviews, it can be reached that the gamified approach is better preferred compared with traditional training, and it contains great potential to practically help hearing-challenged children to realize self-training. Particularly, the high customization of the gamified training approach can facilitate the feasibility in supporting children with different hearing states. It can effectively motivate children to exercise, and meanwhile, the digital training content can be flexibly tailored and updated to meet different training purposes. Moreover, the technical implementation of sound detection and visual recognition is adaptable to various sounds and visual characteristics, which further enhances the technical feasibility of the training system.


# Conclusion
This study is intended to empirically examine the influence of gamified auditory-verbal training on children at different rehabilitation stages. 
Particularly, three research questions were investigated to reveal 
1. the influence of gamified auditory-verbal training on the training performance of children at the advanced rehabilitation stage; 
2. the influence of gamified auditory-verbal training on the training performance of children at the intermediate rehabilitation stage, 
3.  the training experience of the gamified approach. 


For the end, a digital gamified training system was originally developed and prototyped. 31 hearing-challenged children aging three to six years old were recruited to take the training on the digital gamified system. Through the comparison before and after the training and the comparison between children at advanced and intermediate rehabilitation stages, it can be found that generally the gamified training can bring positive influence on basic auditory memory, articulation and expression capabilities, training engagement, and training experience. 

This work is expected to contribute:
1. The empirical examination of the influence of gamified auditory-verbal training on the training performance of hearing-challenged children at different rehabilitation stages; 
2. An in-depth evaluation of the training experience and training feasibility of the gamified auditory-verbal training system; 
3. Valuable insights on the further explorations of the gamification approach in hearing-challenged children’s rehabilitation and education.
